# Clue

This is a basic website designed to help you win clue.
You can use it to keep track of every guess your opponents make, and the program will deduce who has what cards.

It works by cross referencing all guesses to find inconsistancies. For example, if an opponent says, "I can't help you" to "Green, Wrench, Bathroom", but 10 turns later says, "I can help you" to "Mustard, Wrench, Bathroom", then you know that player must have just shown "Mustard".

### Languages

The site uses Jquery, but is otherwise a vanilla site.

### Opening

I don't believe the site is up any longer, but you can open it using any localhost starter (such as http-server).
